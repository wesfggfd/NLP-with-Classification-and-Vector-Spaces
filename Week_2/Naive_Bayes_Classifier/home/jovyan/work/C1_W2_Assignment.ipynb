    "# Assignment 2: Naive Bayes\n",
    "Welcome to week two of this specialization. You will learn about Naive Bayes. Concretely, you will be using Naive Bayes for sentiment analysis on tweets. Given a tweet, you will decide if it has a positive sentiment or a negative one. Specifically you will: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Train a naive bayes model on a sentiment analysis task\n",
    "* Test using your model\n",
    "* Compute ratios of positive words to negative words\n",
    "* Do some error analysis\n",
    "* Predict on your own tweet\n",

    "You may already be familiar with Naive Bayes and its justification in terms of conditional probabilities and independence.\n",
    "* In this week's lectures and assignments we used the ratio of probabilities between positive and negative sentiment.\n",
    "* This approach gives us simpler formulas for these 2-way classification tasks.\n",

    "Before submitting your assignment to the AutoGrader, please make sure you are not doing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You have not added any _extra_ `print` statement(s) in the assignment.\n",
    "2. You have not added any _extra_ code cell(s) in the assignment.\n",
    "3. You have not changed any of the function parameters.\n",
    "4. You are not using any global variables inside your graded exercises. Unless specifically instructed to do so, please refrain from it and use the local variables instead.\n",
    "5. You are not changing the assignment code where it is not required, like creating _extra_ variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do any of the following, you will get something like, `Grader Error: Grader feedback not found` (or similarly unexpected) error upon submitting your assignment. Before asking for help/debugging the errors in your assignment, check for these first. If this is the case, and you don't remember the changes you have made, you can get a fresh copy of the assignment by following these [instructions](https://www.coursera.org/learn/classification-vector-spaces-in-nlp/supplement/YLuAg/h-ow-to-refresh-your-workspace).\n",
